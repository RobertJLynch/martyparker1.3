                <p class="phead"><b>PhD in social science using advanced quantitative methods - Keele University 2017-2020 (ongoing)</b></p>
                <p class="pbody">Healthy Working Life Expectancy (HWLE) is an estimate of the number of years that people can stay healthy and in work. This project will use multi-state interpolated Markov chain modelling to (i) estimate HWLE and (ii) identify factors that reduce HWLE. Further work will model trends in HWLE over the next 20 years. An advisory panel at the Department for Work and Pensions is involved to enhance the application of this work in policy. This collaborative studentship is funded by the ESRC North West Social Science Doctoral Training Partnership.</p>
